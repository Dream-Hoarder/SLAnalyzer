# This is a placeholder for the full suite of tests that would typically be run against the SmartLogAnalyzer module.
# The tests above cover basic functionality of the Get-LogSummary function, ensuring it correctly counts
# log entries based on their levels and handles edge cases like empty or null input.
# Additional tests would be added to cover more complex scenarios, such as different log formats,
# integration with other functions, and error handling.
# The tests are designed to be run in a PowerShell environment with the SmartLogAnalyzer module loaded.
# The tests use the Should module for assertions, ensuring that the output matches expected values.
# The tests are structured to be clear and maintainable, allowing for easy expansion as the module evolves.
# The tests are intended to be run in a continuous integration environment, ensuring that any changes to
# the SmartLogAnalyzer module do not break existing functionality.
# The tests are designed to provide quick feedback on the correctness of the Get-LogSummary function
# and to ensure that it behaves as expected across different scenarios.
# The tests are written in a way that allows for easy identification of issues, with clear assertions
# and descriptive test names.
# The test suite is part of a larger testing framework for the SmartLogAnalyzer module,
# which includes tests for other functions such as Get-LogEntries, Get-SystemLogs, and Invoke-SmartAnalyzer.
# This ensures comprehensive coverage of the module's functionality and helps maintain high code quality.
