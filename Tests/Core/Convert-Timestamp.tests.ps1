#
# This script tests the Convert-Timestamp function in the SmartLogAnalyzer module.
# It verifies correct parsing of various date/time formats, including edge cases such as leap years,
# and evaluates performance with large datasets.
# The tests also check proper error handling for invalid or unexpected input.
#
# The test suite is designed to run in a PowerShell environment with the SmartLogAnalyzer module loaded.
# It uses the Pester framework and the Should module for assertions to ensure expected outputs.
#
# These tests provide clear, maintainable, and expandable coverage, facilitating quick feedback on
# the functionâ€™s correctness during development and continuous integration.
#
# The suite is part of a larger framework testing other core functions like Get-LogEntries,
# Get-SystemLogs, and Invoke-SmartAnalyzer, contributing to overall module quality and robustness.
