# End of Format-LogEntry.tests.ps1
#
# This script tests the Format-LogEntry function of the SmartLogAnalyzer module.
# It verifies the functionâ€™s ability to parse log lines and extract key elements such as
# Level, Message, and Timestamp accurately.
#
# The tests cover a variety of scenarios including:
# - Standard log lines with timestamp, level, and message
# - Edge cases like empty lines, missing timestamps, and malformed entries
# - Performance with large log entries and batch processing
# - Redaction of sensitive information within log messages
# - Robust error handling for null, empty, or unexpected input formats
# - Recognition of multiple log levels and localized timestamp formats
# - Support for custom log formats with additional fields
#
# Implemented using the Pester testing framework and the Should assertion module,
# the tests provide clear and immediate feedback on function correctness and resilience.
#
# Designed to be run in a PowerShell environment with the SmartLogAnalyzer module loaded,
# this suite complements other tests such as Get-LogEntries, Get-SystemLogs, and Invoke-SmartAnalyzer,
# contributing to overall code quality and reliability.
#
# The suite supports continuous integration workflows to detect regressions promptly
# and is structured for maintainability and future expansion as the module evolves.
# The tests are written to be clear and descriptive, allowing for easy identification of issues
# and ensuring that the Format-LogEntry function behaves as expected across various scenarios.
